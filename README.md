# Code Refactor Starter Code

# User Story
AS A marketing agency<br>
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards<br>
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines<br>

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards<br>
WHEN I view the source code<br>
THEN I find semantic HTML elements<br>
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements<br>
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning<br>
WHEN I view the image elements<br>
THEN I find accessible alt attributes<br>
WHEN I view the heading attributes<br>
THEN they fall in sequential order<br>
WHEN I view the title element<br>
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title<br>

# Approaching the Challenge
As a developer I strive for consistency in all of my work. Here is my systematic process for how I met the acceptance criteria:<br>
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Review HTML for visual layout, make necessary adjustments regarding indentations and formatting to make it more legible throughout the code.<br>
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Swap out HTML elements for best practice, specificall "div" for "section"<br>
<strong>Step 3:</strong> Align other HTML elements with best practice, this includes the page title and the alt descriptions of the images.<br>
